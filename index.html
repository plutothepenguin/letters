There's nothing wrong at all with you, it's on them. I have beef with that bitch now. We gon gang up and throw them into the gulag. They gon be pow pow'd then pew pew'd away. THEY AIN'T SHIT, YOU IS THE SHIT. THEY AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON YOU, THE ABSOLUTE BADASS, AYA EL-KERDANY HERSELF.

        Heyy. I'm here for you. It's totally fine to be sad. Just let it all out. Watch The Office, wear a nice fit, cry in the shower. Do whatever helps you. It'll be okay. We can get through this. You've survived 100% of your worst days so far. This ain't nothing. Just a pesky lil problem. Allah only put you here to make you stronger. I'm here for you. ❤

        Ayaaa. Have you been drinking water? Make sure to drink a tonnn of water. And eat!! I know you have a problem with your not eating, so you better eat all the goddamn food you can. And I know you won't take this advice, cuz you're stoopid. But rest. Or else. I will literally fight you. And you won't win, because you didn't rest. So do it. Go. Now. Rest. Byee ❤

        Honestly Aya? You matter so much. You'll matter to the world when you're an award-winning psychiatrist, but right now, you matter to everyone around you. Who knows how many lives you may have saved on Seven Cups. According to you, you saved my life too. You matter to your family. That's why they want to spend so much time with you. You matter to your friends too. And you matter to me. So much. When I say "What would I do without you?" I act like it's sarcastic, but I literally don't know what I'd do with you. You've helped me become closer to Allah, my family, my friends, you've helped me become more confident, less insecure, more thoughtful. You've helped me so much and I'll never be able to repay you. Thank you ❤
